/**
 * A WebGPU helper class implementing a viewport clear operation. When rendering to a texture,
 * the whole surface can be cleared using loadOp, but if only a viewport needs to be cleared, or if
 * it needs to be cleared later during the rendering, this need to be archieved by rendering a quad.
 * This class renders a full-screen quad, and expects the viewport / scissor to be set up to clip
 * it to only required area.
